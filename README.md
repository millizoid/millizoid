### I'm currently a student at BYU studying data science. I'm pretty new to Git and GitHub, so any tips are welcome. I love modeling data in both Python and R, and I am trying to further my skills in both of these languages. Programming and stats both are things that I love doing in my free time, and I love to learn from other people!

### Outside of coding and doing stats, I love being outside, whether it's skiing, running, or hiking. I also love Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, and going to concerts.
