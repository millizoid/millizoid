## About

I am currently a full-time data scientist at Tunnl, located in the Washington DC area. My professional journey has shaped me into a skilled data analyst and statistician with expertise in data science, statistical modeling, and programming. My academic background in Statistics: Data Science has equipped me with a strong foundation in mathematics, R, Python, and SAS, and I've gained hands-on experience in statistical modeling and data ecosystems.

Previously, I held the role of IT Architect at Brigham Young University, where I led significant projects such as developing a documentation website and creating a technical architecture scorecard. I also contributed to AI integration guidelines, which fostered a forward-thinking approach to technology within the organization.

In addition to my professional experience, I have served as a Teaching Assistant and Student Office Assistant, which allowed me to develop excellent communication, organizational, and leadership skills. As an active participant in the BYU Statistics Club, I further honed my expertise by working on statistical models and data visualization projects.

At Tunnl, I continue to leverage my passion for data science, while working on innovative solutions to drive impactful decisions.
I’m a huge fan of programming in general have grown to absolutely love Python and R. My statistical background in data modeling, probability, and analysis has allowed me to help solve problems by combining these skills. Whether it be modeling data from Taylor Swift lyrics or doing five year financial predictions, I love finding ways to predict and represent data.

Outside of statistics and programming, I love spending time outdoors. Whether it be running, skiing, or hiking, it’s very common for me to be outside. I love going to concerts, especially with friends.
